# TODO:
- [ ] My Bidding: After being outbidden, the auction is not shown in the my bidding tab anymore. In that case, one should just see that one has been outbidden. (Keep list of bidders per auction)
- [ ] Ended auctions -> Claim
- [ ] Can anyone close an auction at anytime? Delete auction (seller)?
